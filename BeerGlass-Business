#Beer Glass Recylcing Concept

##Intro
I have worked in restaurants for a couple of years and have noticed the waste, throwing away a drinking glass for simply having a small blemish,
like a crack within the glass that cannot be felt on the outside, but is visible.
This concept intends to recapture the glass, and financial cost of those beer glasses.

##How it works
The business would sell the restaurant beer glasses. These beer glasses are made from recyclable materials, so they can be melted down, and forged into a new 
beer glass without the blemishes. The recycling center would replace the beer glasses sent in with new ones.
The recycling would be available as a paid monthly service. This is due to the loss of material in the process, and cost to run machinery and labor.
